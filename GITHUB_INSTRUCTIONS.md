# Steps to push to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub at https://github.com/new
2. Name it something like "socionics" or "wikisocion-mvp"
3. Don't initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license
4. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name.
